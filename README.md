# Simple Raytracer
This repository is my self learning into computer graphics coding. This will be my learning 
in creating a simple Raytracer using C++. There will be multiple references of videos and lectures linked
under the references down below to show the journey of learning.


# Build Instructions
1. Make sure you have CMake installed.
2. Create a build directory
3. Move into the build directory
  * Linux/Mac
    * Change Directory into the build directory then type in the console ```cmake ..``` after it is done downloading
    there will be a makefile in the build folder. Type make then run the Raytracer executable
  * Windows
    * Create a build folder then build it and run in it your respective IDE
    * You can also create a build folder then in the path type ```cmake ..``` this will build it.
